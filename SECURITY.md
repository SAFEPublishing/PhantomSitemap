## Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting a vulnerability which effects any of the following:

* Privacy of end users
* Security of end users
* Access to secure assets (documents, etc, which are owned by the app)

Please send your report directly to shane@helldritch.com, and I will create an issue. You will receive full (public) credit for the vulnerability once the patch hits production and all major public versions of Phantom are updated.

If your vulnerability doesn't effect any of those key issues, please create a standard issue within this repository in Github. _If the issue doesn't effect any of those key issues, but you feel the severity is such that it needs to be patched before it is made public, you can still contact us directly via email at your discretion._

We will never mock, ignore or otherwise mistreat you for taking an issue seriously, even if we don't feel it warranted secret disclosure. Ultimately, the security and privacy of our users is our prime concern.
